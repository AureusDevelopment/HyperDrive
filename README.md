control. The plugin aims to give players the capability to create, manage, and manipulate their own warps,
admin warps, and even specific warps they have been given access to. HyperDrive is also contains many unique
utilities and features such as a Cross-Server teleportation method, group teleportation, and a full GUI based
warp system.

1) Once the HyperDrive-Recode.jar is acquired, the jar must be placed into your server's plugins folder.
2) Once this is completed,the server must be restarted in order to register and enable the plugin. The plugin
